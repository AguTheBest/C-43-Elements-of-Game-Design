Elements of game design:
1. Playing charecters (pc) and non playing charecters (npc)
Pc - cars
Npc - coins, fuel, cones, tires
2. Goal:
Reaching the finish line before the opponent without crashing or losing out on fuel
3. Rules:
a - the life of the car will reduce when it collides with another car or with obstacles
b - when the cars touch the coins the score will increase.
c - the fuel will increase when the car touches the fuel tank.
d - when the car is moving the fuel slowly depletes .
e - the game will not start unless two players have joined.
f - the game is over when you reach the finish line or you crash or you run out of fuel.
4. Balance:
challenging - avoiding obstacles
luck - where fuel and coins spawn
5. Adaptivity:
To increase the difficulty as the game goes on
6. Feedback:
when you reach the finish line the game tells you your rank
7. Chance vs Skill:
navigating the car through the obstacles
the obstacles and coins are randomly distributed
